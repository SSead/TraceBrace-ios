# What is TraceBrace

TraceBrace is a startup founded by six high school students, who want to be change in the small messed up country & in the world. It all started on a hackathon organised by UN Women. The main goal was to create an IT solution for violence prevention against women, where we created the first prototype of TraceBrace. TraceBrace is a bracelet which sends previously entered SOS messages in the TraceBrace app on your phone. At the end of the message your location is added! We won the first place and earned six months support by UN Women. Since their support ended, we need your help to bring this product to the world & make the change!
